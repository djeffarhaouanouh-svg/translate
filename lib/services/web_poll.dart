/// connection is less reliable (browser throttling, CORS, network
/// hiccups), so callers also want a periodic "just refetch" tick to stay
/// fresh without forcing the user to pull-to-refresh.
///
/// `every(...)` returns `null` on non-web — callers store the result and
/// `?.cancel()` it on dispose unconditionally, which makes the call sites
/// trivially short and platform-agnostic.
